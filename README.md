## Part One

### Let's Get Dapper

1. When in doubt, `yarn` it out in the project directory:

```
yarn
```

2. Run dapper

```
yarn start
```

## Part Two

### Dapploy Some Contracts locally

We need to deploy some smart contracts

1. Use [Dapploy](https://github.com/XYOracleNetwork/tool-dappdeployer-node) and create your first standalone smart contact project:

```
./dapploy init
./dapploy -P
```

**or** Use [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com) to deploy your smart contracts to any Ethereum blockchain, and note the folder of your ABI, usually in `<truffle_project>/build/contracts`

## Part Three

### View Local Contracts

1. If you don't already have it, [download and install Ganache from their site](https://truffleframework.com/ganache)

2. Same with [MetaMask from their site](https://metamask.io/)

3. Configure Ganache on 8545:

- Open Ganache
- Click the Gear Icon thingy ( ‚öôÔ∏è ) to open `Preferences...`.
  Make sure that port is set to 8545.
- Click "Save and Restart" in the top-right of Ganache

4. Configure Metamask network to `localhost`

- Sign into Metamask and change Network on Metamask to localhost 8545

5. Add ganache account to metamask

- In your Ganache UI, you'll see a list of ~10 addresses. Click the key icon (üîë) next to one of 'em. And then COPY the "Private Key"

6. Start dapper. This should open up `localhost:3000` in a chrome browser.

```
yarn start
```

You should see the Dapper UI with no smart contracts loaded.

## Part Four

### Play with your Smart Contracts

1. In Dapper UI, go to the settings cog and select `Local Path` and enter `<truffle_project>/build/contracts` (Priject dir from Pt. II)

2. Tap `Save` and you should be able to see the FungibleToken in the dropdown and play with it!

3. Select `name()` function and you should see the name, "Fun Token" displayed.
